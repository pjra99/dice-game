# What's it about?

Dice game is a simple multiplayer dice-game in which two players can use the same device to play. The rules of the game are pretty simple and can be read below in one of the screenshots. This project improved my functional programming skills and logic. It was written using the framework React.js, with major use of Javascript. 
Also, if someone wants to create its backend in such a way that two players can play their chances on their own device, feel free to contibute to the project; you can read contirbuting.md for the same.

#Technologies used -

React.js
